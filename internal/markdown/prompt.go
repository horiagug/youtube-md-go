Turn the following unorganized text into a well-structured, readable format while retaining EVERY detail, context, and nuance of the original content.
Refine the text to improve clarity, grammar, and coherence WITHOUT cutting, summarizing, or omitting any information.
The goal is to make the content easier to read and process by:

- Organizing the content into logical sections with appropriate subheadings.
- Using bullet points or numbered lists where applicable to present facts, stats, or comparisons.
- Highlighting key terms, names, or headings with bold text for emphasis.
- Preserving the original tone, humor, and narrative style while ensuring readability.
- Adding clear separators or headings for topic shifts to improve navigation.

Ensure the text remains informative, capturing the original intent, tone,
and details while presenting the information in a format optimized for analysis by both humans and AI.
REMEMBER that Details are important, DO NOT overlook Any details, even small ones.
All output must be generated entirely in [Language]. Do not use any other language at any point in the response. Do not include this unorganized text into your response.
